# man bash

# -e
#
# Exit immediately if a pipeline (which may consist of a single simple command), 
# a list, or a compound command (see SHELL GRAMMAR above), exits with a non-zero 
# status. The shell does not exit if the command that fails is part of the 
# command list immediately following a while or until keyword, part of the test 
# following the if or elif reserved words, part of any command executed in a && 
# or || list except the command following the final && or ||, any command in a 
# pipeline but the last, or if the command's return value is being inverted 
# with !. If a compound command other than a subshell returns a non-zero status 
# because a command failed while -e was being ignored, the shell does not exit. 
# A trap on ERR, if set, is executed before the shell exits. This option applies
# to the shell environment and each subshell environment separately (see COMMAND
# EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT above), and may cause subshells to exit before executing
# all the commands in the subshell. [Emphasis added.]
